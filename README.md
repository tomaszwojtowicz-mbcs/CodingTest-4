Task 2/2

Add appropriate data members to the IntegerCollection class and implement the missing methods in the included code that stores a collection of integers. On construction, the collection should be empty. The same number may be stored more than once.

Implement the following methods:
	•	Insert(int x).  Insert an entry for the value “x”.
	•	Erase(int x).  Remove one entry with the value “x” (if one exists) from the collection. 
	•	Erase(int from, int to).  Remove all the entries with a value in the range [from, to).
	•	Count(int from, int to).  Count how many entries have a value in the range [from, to).
